                Sanghamithra Rural Financial Services (SRFS) was incorporated as a “not-for-profit” Company on 15thFebruary,1995. It was promoted by MYRADA, a NGO, in whose projects the Self Help Groups (SHGs) had emerged in 1984-85. They were not primarily micro credit institutions, but institutions that built the self-confidence of poor rural women to solve their problems unitedly. MYRADA encouraged them to save in order to meet their urgent needs for which they were

                RBI and NABARD recognized the potential of these SHGs to be effective and appropriate instruments of financial inclusion. NABARD gave MYRADA a research grant in 1987 of Rs 1 million to promote and train SHGs and to match their savings. Feedback from this research program played a major role in policy changes initiated by RBI and NABARD -namely to allow Banks to lend one bulk loan to the SHGs even if they were not registered providedthey kept records and accounts and functioned as “Association of Persons”. The SHGs were free to decide on loans to individual members.  These policy changes were due to Dr. C. Rangarajan Chairman of RBI and Shri

                SHG Bank Linkage program did not function properly. Branches were too far away, transport poor and travel dangerous. MYRADA approached RBI for permission to start a MFI to fill this space.This is the genesis of Sanghamithra which was embedded in the SHG Bank Linkage program.SRFS built on NABARD’s investment in institutional capacity training of SHGs, encouraged savings and internal lending before the SHG could access a loan from the Banks.This required upfront investment in

          <p className="section-text">
            The model dominated the micro finance eco-system till around 2005. However, NABARD’s involvement in the SHG -Bank Linkage program diminished gradually thereafter. Joint Liability Groups(JLGs) were promoted which were smaller with 5-6 members;they could be formed quickly, no group savings were required and loans extended without much training. The SHGs gradually weakened. This affected the program of Sanghamithra, as the quality and number of SHGs decreased by 2010.

          <p className="section-text">
            The microfinance institutionswhich emerged around this time,prioritised speed, profiteering and standardisation.Finally, as a result of the demand to trace individual loansfrom origin by regulators, the bulk loan to the SHG had to be given up and individual loans had to be advanced directly to individuals. This further weakened the SHGs.

                Withou Sanghamithra took some time to cope with this ecosystem. t a clear strategy of its own to manage the GeneralPurpose Loan category (which comprises 90% of its portfolio), it adopted the JLG approach in some areas, the SHG approach in others and the direct approach without SHG support in new areas. But this could not continue. It was realised that a new strategy had to emerge which had elements of the SHG model (which had provided excellent repayment performance), together with appropriate technology (which had to be tested and integrated with the SHG approach), as well as which gave priority to the interests of the client. But this took time.

                It was decided to pilot a new vertical to respond to loans required quickly and with short tenures.  What emerged was that a large category of people required small loans of

            Rs10,000 to Rs 40,000, but they required them within a few days and were prepared to repay in 5 to 10 weeks either in equal weekly installments or as bullet at the end.
            However, these clients are not members of SHGs; they also did not have any family member who is a SHG member whose credit performance in the SHG would provide insights into the family’s credit worthiness and overall credibility.  To mitigate risk, SRFS adopted external credit scoring, relying in agencies such as CRIF Highmark, to assess clients credit standing. Also, staff visited the client’s business. This is called the TATKAL vertical.

          <p>Implementing it required a strategic overhaul. Processes were streamlined to ensure rapid loan approval and disbursal. Staff were appointed to manage only the TATKAL vertical and were trained to address both the need to deliver loans speedily as well as to address the associated risks effectively. The TATKAL vertical enables SRFS to respond in an appropriate way to the diverse needs of our clients. By March 31,2025 over 1000 TATKAL loans have been extended. A significant feature of the TATKAL vertical is that Clients have returned for loans many times, many over 10. This helps to establish their credit history and build a long-term relationship.</p>

               During the past two years, SRFS received several enquires for start-ups in rural areas. These came from people who had worked in the city for several years in construction, manufacturing and services. They could not afford to live in cities any longer and accommodation was available only in areas where water and sanitation was difficult to get.They decided to return to their villages where they had a home and land.

There is another group who had not left the village but had acquired knowledge and training and desired to add value to farm produce; these are the agripreneurs. Both categories require larger loans than SHGs were accustomed to extend. Many of them, however, belong to families in which there is a SHG member. SRFS decided to start a pilot program with these clients as it had the credit history of the family member in the SHG which indicates the family culture and credit worthiness of the family. The pilot has so far extended loans to 135 clients. The repayment in every case is made digitally.

          <p>The TIREN vertical provides large loans (Rs.2 to 3 lakhs)direct to individuals without partnering with any institution, but with preference to those individuals in whose family there is an SHG member. This verticalfocuses on non- traditional activities, or innovations in traditional ones. Itprovides space for flexible repayment rates (choice of client) in a Joint Support Group (3-4 clients). Finally, it supports the client with pre and post loan services like training in skills,links with markets etc. All costs are paid from CSR. This is critical for inclusion in growth in a sustained manner.
